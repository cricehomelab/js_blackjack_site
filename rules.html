    <h2>Current Ruleset being used:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1. The object of the game is to score higher than the dealer without exceeding a score of 21</li>
        <br>
        <li>2. The dealer and the player will both be dealt 2 cards initially.</li>
        <br>
        <li>3. The player will be able to see both of their cards but only one of the dealer's cards will be exposed.</li>
        <br>
        <li>4. Face cards are worth 10, Aces are wild initially at a value of 11, but will convert to 1 if the score exceeds 21.</li>
        <br>
        <li>5. When the player chooses to stay, the dealer will take their turn, exposing their cards and drawing until they stay.</li>
        <br>
        <li>6. The dealer will hit on anything less than 17.</li>
        <br>
        <li>7. The deck is an infinate meaning each card has a 1 in 52 chance of coming up. This also allows for the possibility of identical cards (IE. 2 Queen of hearts can be in play).</li>        
        <br>
        <li>8. If the score ends with the dealer and the player hands at equal values this is a draw, and there is no winner.</li>
        <br>
        <li>9. At this time Split hands are not implemented.</li>
        <br>
        <li>10. At this time gambling is not implemented.</li>
    </ul>
