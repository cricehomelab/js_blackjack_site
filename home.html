    <p>Hello, and welcome to my Blackjack game. This game is a work in progress and I am working to improve it and make it something I am truly proud of. This is my first project coding in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This project I feel has a lot of potential for learning web development tools and in learning to apply industry standards for how code should be pushed and applied.</p>
    <p>Feel free to play a game and enjoy yourself!</p>
